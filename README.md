While I look for a new role and enjoy then end of the summer, I'm working on updating a small App I made for my Dad. He loves to ski and I wanted to give him the snow reports and forecasts for his favourite area in Austria. I'm rebuilding it with React, Typescript, React Testing-Library and Styled-Components because those are all of my favourite things to work with! 

Here's some things I've made:
* [New WIP SnowCast](https://schneecast.netlify.app/)
* [Old SchneeCast](https://schneecast2018.netlify.app/)
* [Here's who I was in 2019](https://caggers2019.netlify.app/), I'll update it when I have my Dad's app done, I promise!
