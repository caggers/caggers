I'm Gemma, I'm a Front End Software Developer looking for new opportunities in Vancouver, Canada or the world! My area of expertise lies in Javascript and React with over 4 years of experience but I have a passion for interface technologies beyond the browser.

I describe myself as a maker at heart who is happiest covered head to toe in glitter, paint and LEDs. The most important thing for me is to work with smart and creative people who inspire me. I genuinely enjoy peer programming and code reviews as part of a happy and healthy team. A day in my perfect role would have lots of opportunities for collaboration, learning, problem solving and critical thinking.

While I look for a new job and enjoy the end of the summer, I'm working on updating an App I made for my Dad. He loves to ski and I wanted to give him the snow reports and forecasts for his favourite area in Austria. I'm rebuilding it with React, Typescript, React Testing-Library and Styled-Components because those are all of my favourite things to work with!

Here's some things I've made, you can also check out the code in my repos:
* [New WIP SnowCast](https://schneecast.netlify.app/)
* [Old SchneeCast](https://schneecast2018.netlify.app/)
* [Here's who I was in 2019](https://caggers2019.netlify.app/) (_I'll update it when I have my Dad's app done, I promise!_)
